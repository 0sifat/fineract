Welcome to the Mifos community!
===============================

Depending on the OS you're running, you should have "runmifosx.sh" (for Linux and Mac) and
"runmifosx.bat" (for Windows) in this directory. These are small scripts that allow you to
run MifosX on your computer locally. To be able to run MifosX, just double-click on the script,
that is, "runmifosx.sh" if you are on Linux or Mac, or "runmifosx.bat" if you are on Windows.

Note
====
If you have a web front-end that you want to use along with the backend server, put your index.html
inside the "web" folder along with all the other source files.
P.S.: the index.html should be in the "web" folder itself

We hope you'll have an amazing experience working with MifosX.
